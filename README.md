# autonorte_sumo
Simulation scheme of the Autopista Norte de Bogot√° under different scenarios. All scenarios work with the same traffic influx defined as several different routes.

## Autonorte
This is the BAU scenario, it features a dedicated school bus lane that extends all the way until the return in the 205th St.

## Autonorte E1
This scenario incorporates a single change, the school bus dedicated lane starts earlier, right after the brief lane number reduction in the central stream of Autopista Norte. On the other hand, the dedicated lane ends at the final lane reduction at 192th St.

## Autonorte E2
This scenario builds from scenario E1. In addition, the leftmost lane of Autopista Norte from 170th St to 182nd St has been dismantled. It is used for exclusive bus stops, and lanes exclusive to enter or exit the Autopista norte.

## Autonorte E3
This scenario builds from scenario E2. In addition, it removes the return lane on 194th St. All traffic must return either at 205th St or 235th St.
