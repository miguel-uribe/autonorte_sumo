# autonorte_sumo
Simulation scheme of the Autopista Norte de Bogot√° under different scenarios. All scenarios work with the same traffic influx defined as several different routes.

## Autonorte
This is the BAU scenario, it features a dedicated school bus lane that extends all the way until the return in the 205th St.

## Autonorte E1
This scenario incorporates a single change, the school bus dedicated lane starts earlier, right after the brief lane number reduction in the central stream of Autopista Norte. On the other hand, the dedicated lane ends at the final lane reduction at 192th St.

## Autonorte E2
This scenario builds from scenario E1. In addition, the leftmost lane of Autopista Norte from 170th St to 182nd St has been dismantled. It is used for exclusive bus stops, and lanes exclusive to enter or exit the Autopista norte.

## Autonorte E3
This scenario builds from scenario E2. In addition, it removes the return lane on 194th St. All traffic must return either at 205th St or 235th St.

## Autonorte E4
This scenario builds from scenario E2. In addition, the return lane on 194th St is available only to public service buses. Private traffic must go to 205th street to return south.

## Autonorte E5
This scenario builds from scenario E4. It incorporates the shift of the bus stops at 193th, to the south of the pedestrian bridge.

## Autonorte E6
This scenario is identical to scenario E5. However, in this case the return lane on 194th street is available for all traffic. On the other hand, to improve the mobility to the south. The bus stops at Cl 222 and Cl 194th have been relocated.
