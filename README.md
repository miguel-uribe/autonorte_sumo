# autonorte_sumo
Simulation scheme of the Autopista Norte de Bogot√° under different scenarios. All scenarios work with the same traffic influx defined as several different routes.

## Autonorte
This is the BAU scenario, it features a dedicated school bus lane that extends all the way until the return in the 205th St.

## Autonorte E1
This scenario incorporates a single change, the school bus dedicated lane starts earlier, right after the brief lane number reduction in the central stream of Autopista Norte. On the other hand, the dedicated lane ends at the final lane reduction at 192th St.
